-- Problem: to identify sample_id with the following patterns:

-- Sequences that start with ATG (a common start codon)
-- Sequences that end with either TAA, TAG, or TGA (stop codons)
-- Sequences containing the motif ATAT (a simple repeated pattern)
-- Sequences that have at least 3 consecutive G (like GGG or GGGG)
