-- Problem: to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:
-- "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
-- "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
-- "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.

SELECT c.category, COUNT(a.income) AS accounts_count
FROM (
    SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'Average Salary'
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 'High Salary'
) c
LEFT JOIN Accounts a
    ON (c.category = 'Low Salary' AND a.income < 20000)
    OR (c.category = 'Average Salary' AND a.income BETWEEN 20000 AND 50000)
    OR (c.category = 'High Salary' AND a.income > 50000)
GROUP BY c.category
ORDER BY 
    FIELD(c.category, 'Low Salary', 'Average Salary', 'High Salary');
